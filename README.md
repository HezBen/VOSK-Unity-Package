# VOSK-Unity-Package
I put together this package to help. Hopefully the instructions included can help you get started.
When you get a grasp on how it works, it is really easy, you just have to make sure the DLL files in Vosk Voice Recognition/ThirdParty/Vosk/Plugins are set up for your platform, and set to Load on Startup, otherwise when you build it won’t work. And make sure your Streaming assets folder is in the assets folder, not in any subfolder 
Here is the link for the Unity Package, on google docs because I don’t know how to do things
